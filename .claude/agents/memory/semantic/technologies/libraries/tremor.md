## Facts

### Strengths
- Beautiful data visualization components (charts, graphs, KPI cards) [250929_EP_1]
- Built on Tailwind [250929_EP_1]
- Great for dashboards and analytics [250929_EP_1]
- Clean, modern design [250929_EP_1]

### Limitations for Gamification
- Very dashboard/analytics-focused, designed for business intelligence not gaming UX [250929_EP_1]
- Limited interactive components (mostly static visualizations) [250929_EP_1]
- Conservative, professional aesthetic (not playful/engaging) [250929_EP_1]
- Missing gamification essentials: badges, achievement cards, animated progress, XP bars [250929_EP_1]
- Less flexible for custom game-like interactions [250929_EP_1]

## Suggestions

### Hybrid Approach
