## Decisions

- **Technology Stack Selection** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript + Zustand + TanStack Query + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
  - **Status:** Final
  - **Date:** 2025-09-29
  - **Rationale:** Provides fast development, full control, and flexibility for gamification features

- **Design System Choice: Shadcn/ui over alternatives** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Status:** Final
  - **Date:** 2025-09-29
  - **Rationale:** Offers full control through copied components, perfect for custom gamification needs
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Tremor (too dashboard-focused), Mantine, Carbon (too corporate)

## Requirements

- **Requirement: Support gamification mechanics** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** Functional
  - **Priority:** Critical
  - **Status:** Planning
  - **Details:** Must support points/XP, achievements, levels, progress tracking

- **Requirement: Maintainable component ownership** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** Architecture
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Status:** Addressed
  - **Details:** Components must be owned and maintainable within the codebase, not black-box dependencies

## Approaches

### Development Process
- Five-phase approach planned: Foundation → Design System Setup → Core Architecture → MVP Features → Polish & Iterate [250929_EP_1]
- Start with technical foundation before full design system [250929_EP_1]
- Quick prototype of core interaction to validate feel [250929_EP_1]

### Architecture Strategy
- Separation of client state (Zustand) and server state (TanStack Query) [250929_EP_1]
- Component code ownership for maximum flexibility [250929_EP_1]
- Modular structure with clear separation of concerns [250929_EP_1]

## Actions

- **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Status:** Not Started
  - **Tasks:** Initialize project, configure build tools, install core dependencies

- **Phase 2: Design System Setup** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Status:** Not Started
  - **Tasks:** Configure theming, install Shadcn components, create gamification components

- **Phase 3: Core Architecture** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Status:** Not Started
  - **Tasks:** Set up state management, define data models, build layout structure

- **Phase 4: MVP Features** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Status:** Not Started
  - **Tasks:** Implement core game loop, point system, achievements, progress tracking

- **Phase 5: Polish & Iterate** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Status:** Not Started
  - **Tasks:** Add micro-interactions, test with users, refine mechanics
