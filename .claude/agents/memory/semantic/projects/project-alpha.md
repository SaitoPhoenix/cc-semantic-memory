## Facts

### Project Overview
- Focused on gamification with elements like points, XP, achievements, and progression systems [250929_EP_1]
- Named "Project Alpha" as the working title [250929_EP_1]
- Planned to start implementation around October 2nd, 2025 [250929_EP_1]

### Technology Stack
- Full stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Zustand + TanStack Query + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui [250929_EP_1]
- Components will be copied and maintained in the codebase rather than installed as dependencies [250929_EP_1]
- Emphasis on ownership and customizability over convenience [250929_EP_1]

## Decisions

- **Frontend Stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + Zustand + TanStack Query + Tailwind** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** Architecture
  - **Status:** Final
  - **Created:** 2025-09-29
  - **Rationale:** Provides fast development experience with good separation of concerns
  - **Impact:** Defines the core development environment and tools

- **Component Library: Shadcn/ui** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** UI Framework
  - **Status:** Final
  - **Created:** 2025-09-29
  - **Rationale:** Allows full customization of components for gamification-specific needs
  - **Impact:** Components will be maintained within the project codebase

## Requirements

- **Requirement: Support gamification elements** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** Functional
  - **Priority:** Critical
  - **Status:** Open
  - **Details:** Must support vibrant colors, animations, progress indicators, achievement displays, leaderboards, and engaging micro-interactions
  - **Created:** 2025-09-29

- **Requirement: Maintainable component code** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** Technical
  - **Priority:** High
  - **Status:** Open
  - **Details:** Components should be owned and maintainable within the project for full customization freedom
  - **Created:** 2025-09-29

## Approaches

### Development Process
- Following a 5-phase approach: Foundation → Design System Setup → Core Architecture → MVP Features → Polish & Iterate [250929_EP_1]
- Start with technical foundation before implementing game mechanics [250929_EP_1]
- Quick prototyping of core gamification interaction to validate feel [250929_EP_1]

### State Management Strategy
- Zustand for client state (UI state, user preferences, local app state) [250929_EP_1]
- TanStack Query for server state (API data, caching, synchronization) [250929_EP_1]
- Clean separation between "what the user is doing" and "what the data is doing" [250929_EP_1]

## Actions

## Constraints

- **Component Maintenance: Must maintain component code internally** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** Technical
  - **Status:** Active
  - **Scope:** All UI components from Shadcn/ui
  - **Reason:** To ensure full control and customization capability for gamification needs
  - **Created:** 2025-09-29

- **Tailwind CSS Required: Must use Tailwind for styling** [250929_EP_1]
  - **Category:** Technical
  - **Status:** Active
  - **Scope:** All styling in the project
